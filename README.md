# Camera_Calibration_using_AprilTag
Implement a Project to Calibrate a Camera using Apriltag. 
The work is based on the paper ``A ﬂexible new technique for camera calibration" by Zhengyou Zhang. We implemented this using Matlab 2021b. This work can estimates the parameters of a lens and image sensor of an image or video camera to determine a 3D point’s projection onto the image plane using AprilTag placed in real world.
